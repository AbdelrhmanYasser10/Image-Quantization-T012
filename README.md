# Image-Quantization-T012
FCIS Algorithms Project 22'
# Structs , And Classes Implemented
## Edge Struct : 
• Used For Describe Edges in the graph
• Key -> Parent Node
• Value -> child Node
• Weight -> cost on Edge
## GlobalDataForProjectOperationsClass [static class]: 
• Used For the values that repeated a lot and needed in more than one place in code
• Width -> Image Width
• Height -> Image Height
• distincitColorsCounter -> number of distinct colors in image
• For MST [parent for each node array , costs array]
• For Bonuses [number of predicted clusters , counter for predicted clusters , previous result of 
total standard deviation in the First Bonus]
## ProjectOperationsClass: 
• Handle all functions that will be needed in the project
